# DIY Tetris

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling tetrominoes (geometric shapes composed of four square blocks) to create complete rows, which are then cleared from the playing field. The game ends if the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay: Players can move, rotate, and drop tetrominoes using keyboard controls.
- Score tracking: Players earn points for clearing rows and the score is displayed in real-time.
- Dynamic difficulty: The speed of the falling tetrominoes increases as the game progresses, making it more challenging over time.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys (left, right, down, up) to move and rotate the falling tetrominoes.
3. Try to complete rows by filling them with tetrominoes. Completed rows will be cleared, and you will earn points.
4. The game ends if the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript: Programming language used for game logic and interaction.
- HTML5 Canvas: Web technology used for rendering graphics and animations.
- CSS: Styling language used for visual presentation.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the game interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file containing the styles for the game interface.
- `tetris.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic and interaction.
- `tetrominoes.js`: JavaScript file containing the tetromino shapes and colors.
